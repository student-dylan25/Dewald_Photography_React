# Dewald_Photography_React

## Summary
    I'm a photographer/programmer from the United States. I want to start creating my website with React at the helm. I'm new to React but will learn as I go and develop a website to show of my photography skills as well. Two birds with one stone as they say.

### Rules to Follow
    * KISS(Keep it simple stupid)
    * Engaging design but not confusing
    * Responsive Web Design always
    * Functionality over appearance is preferred
